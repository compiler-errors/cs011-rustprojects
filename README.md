# cs011-rustprojects

The project I chose to focus on in CS 11 (Fall term 2015-2016) is a Rust
language Ray Tracer. I like computer graphics, and since the C++ Advanced
track is also doing a Ray Tracer, I think it would be interesting to try it
in this novel language!

22 - Implement framework for Ray Tracer
  (impl, operator override, crates)
29 - Implement sphere, simple diffuse BDRF and simple scene model, camera
  (a bit of linalg, math in rust)
5  - Implement more shapes
  (inheritance, match)
12 - Implement live visualization of scene
  (learn about GUI in rust)
19 - Implement more BRDFs, transparency, reflectivity
  (ray tracing theory)
26 - Implement/think about ways that concurrency can be introduced
  (lambdas, concurrency, concurrent memory management)
3  - Meshes? Path-tracing rewrite of the tracer? Other cool ray stuff??
